Hey! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ana, a 31 years old Software Engineer, born, raised and living in Brazil.

I've been a developer since I was 18 years old, when I had my first intership while still in college. At this intership, I worked with C# and the .NET framework ecosystem, which I worked for 8 years, along with other stacks like Javascript (only with html and css, not in the server yet) and a little bit of Angular. After that, I started working more with Javascript in the backend, using Typescript and NodeJS, which has been my main focus for the last 5 years. I've also been working with GraphQL (and REST, of course), AWS as the main cloud provider, which I've learned a lot by working mostly with DynamoDB, SQS and Lambdas.

I've worked as a Tech Lead from Oct-2023 until Dec-2024 for a fintech company, with a 5 people team, including: 2 backend developers, 1 mobile developer, 1 product manager and 1 product designer. I worked very closely to the PM and the PD, since we decided together what were the team's next steps, along with the company's big picture. I've learned A LOT about this role and about myself in just one year. It was quite a journey.

Feel free to reach out :D
